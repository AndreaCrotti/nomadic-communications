h1. DESCRIPTION

This project is about testing network performances with different wireless devices and configurations.

Results are then statistically analyzed and there will be 2 relations (in latex) explaining the results.


h1. USAGE

This program firt load the default configuration from __config.ini__ and then all the __*.ini__ files found in the __configs__ folder.
The configuration are merged and loaded in a big list, which is analyzed and resorted in order to need the minimal human input as possible.

The list is in fact divided in sublists which contain configurations which different only by parameter than can be set automatically by the program itself (in this moment just "iperf").

After having loaded all the configurations it starts to execute them, waiting for the user confirmation when needed and store the results to a database file (using shelve).

Data are also plotted after being generated, but the plot is just for instant visualization, and can be redraw much better in the phase of the analysis of the results.

So in order to use this program you need to
* Configure correcly __config.ini__ for your setup
* run __python tester.py__
* follow the instructions
