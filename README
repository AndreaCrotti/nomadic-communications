Before everything else install git, on linux and macosx it's very easy and it also comes with a nice gui, "git gui" to open it.
After set some global variables, so you don't need to write them for every commit.

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com

Which globally sets your name and email for your user. (in $HOME/.gitconfig)

To checkout our repository just execute this command (using http it works everywhere even with proxies):

andreaMb:nomadic andrea$ git clone http://github.com/AndreaCrotti/nomadic-communications.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/andrea/nomadic/nomadic-communications/.git/
got e5d818772797e05d86ed94be97d77a506a1f3ae1
walk e5d818772797e05d86ed94be97d77a506a1f3ae1

got e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391

As you see it creates the whole repository in the directory "nomadic-communications"
Now you can start editing or creating new files.
Whenever you create a new file just

andreaMb:labs andrea$ touch file
andreaMb:labs andrea$ git add file

And when you have finished your editing session
