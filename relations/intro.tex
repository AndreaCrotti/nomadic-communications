%\subsection{}

The purpose of the project is the evaluation of the performances variation of a wireless network 802.11 b/g at the change of some parameters.
 
In order to make those tests we used some tools whitch are Iperf, wireshark, and a complex python script for the automated run test.

The test consist basicaly in many automatic execution of iperf with fixed time and different speed and finaly we consider the amount of transfering data.

The set of the tests was an indoor environment a notebook wich run iperf as server, an other notebook wich run iperf as client (throw the python script), a cisco ap and another notebook wich run wireshark to sniff the traffic.
