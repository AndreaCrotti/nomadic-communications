% Everything that comes from theory and that is needed to understand and describe our work.
% A simple description of how an IEEE 802.11 protocol works to introduce the fact that there is some overhead added by the protocol.
	\subsection{Differences between 802.11b and 802.11g} \label{theory:prot_differences}
		% Yes, I know it's unbelivable but there are some differences, for real! :)
		% Calculate protocols upperbound limitations and similar things (report the formulas!).
		% DO NOT USE PROFESSOR SLIDES AS SOURCE OF INFORMATIONS SINCE MOST OF VALUES ARE COMPLETELY WRONG!!!!!!!!!
