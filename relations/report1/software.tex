\subsection{Software} \label{setup:software}
	% ssh keys, iwconfig, python software, iperf, tcpdump, gnuplot, whatever used


%For setting up our network we used the iwconfig

\noindent
For measuring the traffic we wrote a python script which makes use of other software.

Python is a simple, interpreted, object oriented scripting language with a large set of libraries.
These are the pieces of software we used for our project:

\begin{description}
	\item[iperf]
		measures throughput of traffic between two hosts, not limited to wireless setups.
		It only has a command-line interface, with many options to configure its behavior, some of which we changed throughout our tests, while keeping others the same.

		The tool can do UDP and TCP traffic tests.
		While TCP would measure the throughput which the end-user experiences in most cases, the connectionless UDP option is closer to the low-level details which we were interested in. Hence, we chose to only use this feature.

		% more detail?

	\item[tcpdump]
		is a packet sniffer which logs packets sent through one interface. Optionally you can specify a filter on the command line to get only packets you are interested in.
		The output file is a binary format, ({\em pcap}), which can be then read by many other applications like Wireshark.
		
	\item[Wireshark]
		is a graphical tool which helps you analyze captured traffic by parsing packets and displaying structured information about them.
		We used this tool in the beginning to see where we can refine our work, but in the end the program was not used anymore.

	\item[gnuplot]
		is an application which can represent data in graphs of many types. It has an interactive text interface, as well as it can be used as a library by a piece of software. We used it with the help of the wrapper library ``python-gnuplot'' for python.

	\item[paramiko]
		is a library for python to establish SSH connections.
		This is used for remote controlling the hosts on which the iperf server or client is running.

The python script was mainly written by Andrea Crotti.  Its main goal is to
automate as many tasks as possible to do our measurement.  The main strength
of the program is its configurability.  From simple configuration ({\em ini})
files it reads the required information about the network topology as well as
the settings to apply when testing the throughput.

A comprehensive description can be found in the file {\tt README.textile}.


\subsubsection{The Script}

\noindent
The script \verb|tester.py| is the entry point for the program, and it has support for per-user configuration:
To invoke a test, the program is launched as {\tt ./tester.py \textit{name}},
after placing a configuration file at the location {\tt userconfs/\textit{name}.ini}.
There is also a global configuration file, {\tt default.ini}, which is read at first.
Its values have a lower precedence, thus they are overridden by the per-user configuration file.

For different tests, there are again configuration files inside the {\tt configs} folder,
which in turn override some of the configuration before doing the actual experiment.

The contents of these files are described in the next section.

%For the options we considered, see Section \ref{sec:parameters}.
